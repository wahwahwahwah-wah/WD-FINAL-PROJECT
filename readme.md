## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any `.html` files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming follows camel case.
   - Camel case is a naming format where there is no white space in separation of each word, the first word is in all lowercase while the succeeding words' first letter is uppercase followed by lowercase letters.
   - e.g., `buttonAnimatedStyle.css`
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names is a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it is holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
